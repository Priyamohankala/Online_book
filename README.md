  <h2>ABSTRACT:</h2>

The main objective of the project is to create an online book store that allows users to purchase a book online based on  book title and domain of the book. The selected books are
displayed in a cart and the user can order their books online through credit card payment.users can also remove the books after they are added to the cart. In today’s fast-changing
business environment, it’s extremely important to be able to respond to client needs in the most effective and timely manner.  Using this Website the user can purchase a book online
instead of going out to a book store and wasting time. There are many online book stores like Powell’s, Amazon which were designed using Html. I want to develop a similar website 
using  html,javascript,bootstrap,mysql. Online Book store is an online web application where the customer can purchase books online. Through a web browser the customers can select
a book by its title , and can add to the shopping cart and finally purchase using credit card transaction. The user can login using his account details or new customers can set up
an account very quickly. They should give the details of their name, contact number and shipping address. The user can also give feedback to a website by submitting feedback form.
The books are divided into many categories based on different stream like Cse,Ece,EEE. The Online Book Store Website provides customers with online shopping through a web browser.
A customer can, create, sign in to his account, place items into a shopping cart and purchase using his credit card details. The Administrator will have additional functionalities
when compared to the common user. He can login the website using his username and password and see all the customers details stored in the database .This application is developed 
using html,css,javascript,servlet,jsp,Bootstrap. This document will discuss each of the underlying technologies to create and implement an Online book store website. 
We have gained a lot of practical knowledge from this project, which we think, shall make us stand in a good state in the future.
